# PDFColorSwap

PDFColorSwap is a command line tool for color conversion of PDF files written in python. It can replace all occurrences of given color with another one.

It's very useful when there's a need to print something but the printer lacks or has low amount of black ink and has some color ink to spare. In this case swapping black color with for instance darker blue should get the job done. 

## Supported PDF ColorSpaces

* /DeviceRGB
* /DeviceCMYK
* /DeviceGray

Color conversion may not work correctly if pdf file is using different color spaces.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7 or newer

## Installation

* Download PDFColorSwap source
* Unpack it
* Run setup.py with command from its directory:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

## Usage

To use this tool, destination color hex string and path to input pdf file must be provided.
Color hex is prefixed with # and contain 3 hexadecimal values corresponding to RGB color values (#rrggbb).

### Examples
```
$ pdfcolor.py #000066 input.pdf
// converts whole document from black to dark blue

$ pdfcolor.py -c #101010 -o myOutput.pdf #000066 input.pdf
// convert whole document from dark grey to dark blue and save as myOutput.pdf

$ pdfcolor.py -c #101010 -p 0 -o myOutput.pdf #000066 input.pdf
// convert only the first page from from dark grey to dark blue and save as myOutput.pdf
```

### Options

* [-o filename] 
* * Specifies the name of output file (default output.pdf)
* [-O path]
